# DevOps Project
 Purpose:  To provide evidence of knowledge around the devops lifecycle.
 
 Simple html file that utilizes javascript and bootstrap.
 
 Why this project?  Because I've not worked with bootstrap for my interface before and wanted to explore options for future projects.
 
 In the html directory:
 
 index.html = homepage
 bootstrap_agenda_demo.html = another page that shows a different bootstrap option
 Dockerfile = My dockerfile that will build my docker image
 Images folder = my computacenter image
 one-page-wonder.css = some css styling options
 
 wrapper.sh = my wrapper file that executes nginx
 
 Build your image
 docker build -t lkomidar/devops .
 
 Run your image
 docker run -p 8888:80 lisakomidar/devops
 
 
 
# devops
# devops
